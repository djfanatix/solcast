Homey app using the Solcast API to get solar forecasts customized for your location and installation

## Purpose

The app will download every half hour the latest solar forecast with the current forecasted value, and the next 1, 2 and 3 hours.
Every night at Midnight, it will download the accumulated forecasts for Today and Tomorrow.

Every 5 minutes the app will upload your current solar production to fine-tune the prediction model of your solcast forecast.

## Usage
You could use the app to switch on electric appliances or charge a car or battery based on the forecast solar power, to maximize self-consumption.
You can compare the daily forecast with your actual production.
